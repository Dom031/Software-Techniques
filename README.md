Software Engineering Techniques - Labs
This repository contains the lab work for the Software Engineering Techniques module at the University of Hertfordshire. It is designed to help track and manage lab assignments across multiple machines.

Note: This is my first attempt at properly learning GitHub, so the repository might not be the most organized. Feedback and suggestions for improvement are welcome!

Repository Structure
Each lab is organized in its respective directory:

/lab1: Introduction to C++ programming and basic syntax.
/lab2: Version control with Git - setting up repositories, branching, merging.
/lab3: Control flow and debugging.
/lab4: More advanced C++ concepts (to be added).
... (and so on)
